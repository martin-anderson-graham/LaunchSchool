02. Without looking into your notes, try to remember which primitive data types are defined in JavaScript. Then find this information on MDN.
  number
  string
  boolean
  undefined
  null
  BigInt
  symbol

03. Using the documentation, determine how we can find the largest numeric value that can be represented in JavaScript. Write a line of code that returns this value.
  Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  also Number.MAX_VALUE

04. Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out which result the expression 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10 evaluates to.
  20.9 is my guess
  
05. Find out what Date.now() returns.
  number of milliseconds since jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC

06. What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you use? (Date.getYear() Date.getFullYear())
  getYear give currentYear - 1900, so not so good post 2000
  getFullYear should be used instead

07. How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect? What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?
  0 or 1 - will be used as the seperator (blank use comma)

08. Find out how we can join two or more strings together.
  + operator
  str1.concat(str2, str3...)

10. explan the error
  .lenght is a property, not a method, so the () after .length are incorrect
