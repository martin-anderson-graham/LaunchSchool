1. ## In your own words, what is Object Oriented Programming?

Object oriented programming is a style of writing programs that focuses on organizing the elements of programs into bundles of state and behavior.  Just like in the physical world, we consider things as collections of properties and actions that thing can take.  For instance, there are many cars, but they have different colors, ages, mileage, (state) and they share certain actions (park, drive, reverse, sell, buy)

2. ## Describe some advantages and disadvantages of OOP.

An advantage of OOP is that our program are organized similar to how we think and categorize the world around us - therefore the programs are simpler to read and understand.  Also, it is easier to hide implementation behind abstraction - electric and gas cars accelerate using very different methods under the hood, but we operate them with the same pedals!
  - Higher-level of abstraction, easier to break-down problems
  - Programmers are able to reduce dependencies in the program, making maintenance easier
  - OOP programs can be easier to understand and to change

A disadvantage is that our programs will be longer then they could be if optimized for size, and they will take more memory (holding all that state and behavior) than a program written in a procedural style.

3. ## In your own words, what does encapsulation refer to in JavaScript?

Encapsulation refers to bundling state and behavior together (in an object in this case.)  We will assign properties to our objects (state) as well as methods (behavior).

4. ## In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?

The lack of access restrictions on objects is a major difference - properties and methods of objects are exposed (always?).
