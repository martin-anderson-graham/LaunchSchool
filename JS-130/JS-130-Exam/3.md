At a high level, three benefits strict mode provides includes the following:
1. Some errors that were previously silent are made explicit.
1. Some code that limited optimization is forbidden
1. Some code that will/may become deprecated is forbidden.

Here are a few specific behaviors which help the developer avoid common issues:
1. The implicit execution context of functions is set to `undefined`
1. Octal literals (numbers represented in base-8) are forbidden, meaning developers won't accidentally use them when they don't mean to.
1. Forgetting to use `this` in a method will raise an error

For my example I will discuss the last behavior - not using `this` in a method.  In the `setFuelLevel` method the failure to include write `this.fuelLevel` means the method is actually initializing and assigning a property on the global object called `fuelLevel` - the last lines verify this.

```javascript
function Car() {
  this.fuelLevel = 100;
}
Car.prototype.setFuelLevel = function(num) {
  fuelLevel = num;
};

let aCar = new Car();
aCar.setFuelLevel(90);

console.log(aCar.fuelLevel); //100
console.log(fuelLevel); //90
```

In strict mode an error is thrown, preventing me from making this error accidentally.
```JavaScript
"use strict";

function Car() {
  this.fuelLevel = 100;
}
Car.prototype.setFuelLevel = function(num) {
  fuelLevel = num;
};

let aCar = new Car();
aCar.setFuelLevel(90);

console.log(aCar.fuelLevel);
//Uncaught ReferenceError: fuelLevel is not defined

console.log(fuelLevel);
```
